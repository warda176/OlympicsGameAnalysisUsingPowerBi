Olympic Games Analysis


Business problem:  As a data analyst working at a news company you are asked to visualize data that will help readers understand how countries have performed historically in the summer Olympic Games.
You also know that there is an interest in details about the competitors, so if you find anything interesting then donâ€™t hesitate to bring that in also. 
The main task is still to show historical performance for different countries, with the possibility to select your own country."
